                    Time saving vs coordinated rest
                    Remote work allows you to save up to 2 hours on the way to the office and back. Saving time is a
                    plus. However, for some people, a trip to the office is the very minutes or even hours in which you
                    can escape from everyday and work problems. This forced "disconnection" from worries makes it
                    possible to be alone and reboot the brain. On the other hand, this time could be allocated and
                    consciously, when and how you need it. But psychologically it's a little more complicated.
                    Individual environment vs ready-made resources.
                    Another point of remote work, which was initially attributed to the advantages, is the opportunity
                    to work in a familiar environment, on convenient equipment, as well as eat homemade food. But
                    someone will immediately say that the home environment may not always be conducive to work, and
                    homemade food still needs to be cooked, and working equipment needs to be taken from somewhere. And
                    as a result, some are happy with the freedom of choice and begin to equip the place as they are
                    comfortable and their productivity will melt. Others do not want to equip anything and just
                    accumulate <mark>discontent.</mark>
